# atlas
A small utility for generating a texture atlas from all the images and truetype
fonts in a directory.


## Basic usage
```bash
atlas assetdir
```
This will pack the images and fonts from `assetdir` and create the file
`out.png`. `out.txt` will also be created, containing a list of all the packed
images and their locations.

The `-f` argument can be used to specify a custom line format for the text file,
for example, the following might be used for XML:
```bash
atlas -f "<image name='%s' x='%d' y='%d' width='%d' height='%d'/>" assetdir
```

Run `atlas --help` for a list of all possible arguments.

## Example
The directory 'example/' contains an example for generating texture atlas. The expected outputs are
'example/out.png' and 'example/out.txt'. I
